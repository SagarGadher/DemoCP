      Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or
      more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a
      statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to
      be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition
      is determined to be false.<br />
      Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure
      found in most of the programming languages:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Sr.No.</th>
        <th>Statement</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>if statement</td>
        <td>
          An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or
          more statements.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>if...else statement</td>
        <td>
          An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which
          executes when the Boolean expression is false.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>nested if statements</td>
        <td>
          You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if
          statement(s).
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>switch statement</td>
        <td>
          A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against
          a list of values.
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>nested switch statements</td>
        <td>
          You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <div class="SubTopic">The ? : Operator</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can
      be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
      <code>
          Exp1 ? Exp2 : Exp3;
      </code>
  </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement
      of the colon.<br />
      The value of a ? expression is determined like this :
    </p>
    <pre class="KeyPointScroll">
    >Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
    
    >If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

    </pre>
