      The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you
      can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a
      term BYTE for one-byte numbers :
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
        <code>
    typedef unsigned char BYTE;
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an
      abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
      <code>
BYTE  b1, b2;
      </code>
  </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind
      the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can
      use lowercase, as follows :
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
    <code>
typedef unsigned char byte;
    </code>
</pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as
      well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data
      type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as
      follows :
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
    <code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
  
typedef struct Books {
    char title[50];
    char author[50];
    char subject[100];
    int book_id;
} Book;
  
int main( ) {

    Book book;
  
    strcpy( book.title, "C Programming");
    strcpy( book.author, "Nuha Ali"); 
    strcpy( book.subject, "C Programming Tutorial");
    book.book_id = 6495407;
  
    printf( "Book title : %s\n", book.title);
    printf( "Book author : %s\n", book.author);
    printf( "Book subject : %s\n", book.subject);
    printf( "Book book_id : %d\n", book.book_id);

    return 0;
}
    </code>
</pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result :</p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
    <code>
Book  title : C Programming
Book  author : Nuha Ali
Book  subject : C Programming Tutorial
Book  book_id : 6495407
    </code>
</pre>
<div class="SubTopic">typedef vs #define</div>
<p class="ParaDetail">#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences :<br/><br/>
        typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.<br/><br/>
        typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.<br/><br/>
    The following example shows how to use #define in a program :</p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
        <code>
#include <stdio.h>

#define TRUE  1
#define FALSE 0
  
int main( ) {
    printf( "Value of TRUE : %d\n", TRUE);
    printf( "Value of FALSE : %d\n", FALSE);

    return 0;
}     
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result :</p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
        <code>
Value of TRUE : 1
Value of FALSE : 0
        </code>
    </pre>
