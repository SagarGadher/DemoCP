    <p class="ParaDetail">
      You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to
      understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
    </p>
    <div class="SubTopic">Tokens in C</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an
      identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the
      following C statement consists of five tokens:
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code> 
printf("Hello, World! \n");                     
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">The individual tokens are:</p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code> 
printf
(
"Hello, World! \n"
)
;                     
            </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="SubTopic">Semicolons</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each
      individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end
      of one logical entity. <br />
      Given below are two different statements :
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
    <code>
printf("Hello, World! \n");
return 0;      
    </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="SubTopic">Comments</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by
      the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as
      shown below:
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
      <code>
/* my first program in C */
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a
      string or character literals.
    </p>
    <div class="SubTopic">Identifiers</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any
      other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to
      z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and
      digits (0 to 9).<br />
      C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within
      identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower
      and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of
      acceptable identifiers:
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
      <code>
mohd       zara    abc   move_name  a_123
myname50   _temp   j     a23b9      retVal
      </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="SubTopic">Keywords</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may
      not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
      <code>
auto 	else 	long 	switch
break 	enum 	typedef register
case 	extern 	return 	union
char 	float 	short 	unsigned
const 	for 	signed 	void
goto 	sizeof 	double  continue
if 	static 	while   default
do 	int 	struct 	_Packed 			
      </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="SubTopic">Whitespace in C</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a
      blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.<br />
      Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline
      characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from
      another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a
      statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in
      the following statement:
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
      <code>
int age;        
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between
      int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other
      hand, in the following statement:
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
      <code>
fruit = apples + oranges;   // get the total fruit
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between =
      and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase
      readability.
    </p>
