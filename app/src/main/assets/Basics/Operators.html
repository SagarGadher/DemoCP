        An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific
        mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in
        operators and provides the following types of operators:

                    <p class="ParaDetail">
                        Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an
                        expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the
                        multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.<br />
                        For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher
                        precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.<br />
                        Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the
                        lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be
                        evaluated first.</p>
