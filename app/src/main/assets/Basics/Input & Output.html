    <p class="ParaDetail">
      When we say Input, it means to feed some data into a program. An input can
      be given in the form of a file or from the command line. C programming
      provides a set of built-in functions to read the given input and feed it
      to the program as per requirement.<br /><br />
      When we say Output, it means to display some data on screen, printer, or
      in any file. C programming provides a set of built-in functions to output
      the data on the computer screen as well as to save it in text or binary
      files.
    </p>
    <div class="SubTopic">The Standard Files</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      C programming treats all the devices as files. So devices such as the
      display are addressed in the same way as files and the following three
      files are automatically opened when a program executes to provide access
      to the keyboard and screen.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Standard File</th>
        <th>File Pointer</th>
        <th>Device</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Standard Input</td>
        <td>stdin</td>
        <td>keyboard</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Standard Output</td>
        <td>stdout</td>
        <td>Screen</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Standard error</td>
        <td>stderr</td>
        <td>Your screen</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p class="ParaDetail">
      The file pointers are the means to access the file for reading and writing
      purpose. This section explains how to read values from the screen and how
      to print the result on the screen.
    </p>
    <div class="SubTopic">The getchar() and putchar() Functions</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      The int getchar(void) function reads the next available character from the
      screen and returns it as an integer. This function reads only single
      character at a time. You can use this method in the loop in case you want
      to read more than one character from the screen.<br /><br />
      The int putchar(int c) function puts the passed character on the screen
      and returns the same character. This function puts only single character
      at a time. You can use this method in the loop in case you want to display
      more than one character on the screen. Check the following example :
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
#include <stdio.h>
int main( ) {

    int c;

    printf( "Enter a value :");
    c = getchar( );

    printf( "\nYou entered: ");
    putchar( c );

    return 0;
}
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">When the above code is compiled and executed, it waits for you to input some text. When you enter a text and press enter, then the program proceeds and reads only a single character and displays it as follows :</p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
$./a.out
Enter a value : this is test
You entered: t
            </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="SubTopic">The gets() and puts() Functions</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">The char *gets(char *s) function reads a line from stdin into the buffer pointed to by s until either a terminating newline or EOF (End of File).

            The int puts(const char *s) function writes the string 's' and 'a' trailing newline to stdout.
            
            <strong>NOTE:</strong>Though it has been deprecated to use gets() function, Instead of using gets, you want to use fgets().</p>
            <pre class="CodeBlock">
                    <code>
#include <stdio.h>
int main( ) {

    char str[100];

    printf( "Enter a value :");
    gets( str );

    printf( "\nYou entered: ");
    puts( str );

    return 0;
}
                    </code>
            </pre>
            <p class="ParaDetail">When the above code is compiled and executed, it waits for you to input some text. When you enter a text and press enter, then the program proceeds and reads the complete line till end, and displays it as follows :</p>
            <pre class="CodeBlock">
                    <code>
$./a.out
Enter a value : this is test
You entered: this is test
                    </code>
            </pre>
            <div class="SubTopic">The scanf() and printf() Functions</div>
            <p class="ParaDetail">The int scanf(const char *format, ...) function reads the input from the standard input stream stdin and scans that input according to the format provided.<br/><br/>
                    The int printf(const char *format, ...) function writes the output to the standard output stream stdout and produces the output according to the format provided.<br/><br/>
                    The format can be a simple constant string, but you can specify %s, %d, %c, %f, etc., to print or read strings, integer, character or float respectively. There are many other formatting options available which can be used based on requirements. Let us now proceed with a simple example to understand the concepts better :</p>
            <pre class="CodeBlock">
                    <code>
#include <stdio.h>
int main( ) {

    char str[100];
    int i;

    printf( "Enter a value :");
    scanf("%s %d", str, &i);

    printf( "\nYou entered: %s %d ", str, i);

    return 0;
}
                    </code>
            </pre>
            <p class="ParaDetail">When the above code is compiled and executed, it waits for you to input some text. When you enter a text and press enter, then program proceeds and reads the input and displays it as follows :</p>
            <pre class="CodeBlock">
                    <code>
$./a.out
Enter a value : seven 7
You entered: seven 7
                    </code>
            </pre>
            <p class="ParaDetail">Here, it should be noted that scanf() expects input in the same format as you provided %s and %d, which means you have to provide valid inputs like "string integer". If you provide "string string" or "integer integer", then it will be assumed as wrong input. Secondly, while reading a string, scanf() stops reading as soon as it encounters a space, so "this is test" are three strings for scanf().</p>
