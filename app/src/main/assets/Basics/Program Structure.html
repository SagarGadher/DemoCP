    <p class="ParaDetail">
      Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language,
      let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it
      as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
    </p>
    <p class="KeyPoint">
      A C program basically consists of the following parts:<br /><br />
      Preprocessor Commands<br /><br />
      Functions<br /><br />
      Variables<br /><br />
      Statements &<br /><br />
      Expressions Comments<br /><br />
    </p>
    <div class="SubTopic">Hello World Example</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World":
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
        <code>
#include <stdio.h>

        int main() {
            /* my first program in C */
            printf("Hello, World! \n");
            
            return 0;
        }         
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
            Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program:
    </p>
    <p class="KeyPoint">
            The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.<br/><br/>
            The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.<br/><br/>
            The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.<br/><br/>
            The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.<br/><br/>
            The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.<br/><br/>
