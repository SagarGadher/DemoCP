    <p class="ParaDetail">
      Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential
      collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a
      collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a
      collection of variables of the same type.<br /><br />
      Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ...,
      and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use
      numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual
      variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.<br /><br />
      All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address
      corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last
      element.

    <div class="SubTopic">Declaring Arrays</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements
      and the number of elements required by an array as follows:
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
		<code>
type arrayName [ arraySize ];
		</code>
</pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an
      integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type.
      For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double,
      use this statement:
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
double balance[10];
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10
      double numbers.
    </p>
    <div class="SubTopic">Initializing Arrays</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single
      statement as follows:
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number
      of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].<br />
      If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the
      initialization is created. Therefore, if you write:
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
double balance[] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example.
      Following is an example to assign a single element of the array :
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
balance[4] = 50.0;
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of
      50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also
      called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of
      the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the
      array we discussed above:
    </p>

    <div class="SubTopic">Accessing Array Elements</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing
      the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the
      array. For example :
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
double salary = balance[9];
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays:</p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>                    
#include <stdio.h>
    
int main () {

    int n[ 10 ]; /* n is an array of 10 integers */
    int i,j;
    
    /* initialize elements of array n to 0 */         
    for ( i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
        n[ i ] = i + 100; /* set element at location i to i + 100 */
    }
    
    /* output each array element's value */
    for (j = 0; j < 10; j++ ) {
        printf("Element[%d] = %d\n", j, n[j] );
    }
    
    return 0;
}
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result :</p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
Element[0] = 100
Element[1] = 101
Element[2] = 102
Element[3] = 103
Element[4] = 104
Element[5] = 105
Element[6] = 106
Element[7] = 107
Element[8] = 108
Element[9] = 109                    
            </code>
    </pre>
