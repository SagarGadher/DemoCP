    <p class="ParaDetail">
      You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed
      several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially:
      The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the
      second, and so on<br />
      Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for
      more complicated execution paths.<br />
      A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements
      multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in
      most of the programming languages:

    <p class="ParaDetail">
      C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle
      looping requirements.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Sr.No.</th>
        <th>Loop Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>while loop</td>
        <td>
          Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is
          true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>for loop</td>
        <td>
          Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the
          code that manages the loop variable.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>do...while loop</td>
        <td>
          It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition
          at the end of the loop body.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>nested loops</td>
        <td>
          You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or
          do..while loop.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <div class="SubTopic">Loop Control Statements</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When
      execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that
      scope are destroyed.<br /><br />
      C supports the following control statements.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Sr.No.</th>
        <th>Control Statement</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>break statement</td>
        <td>
          Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the
          statement immediately following the loop or switch.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>continue statement</td>
        <td>
          Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately
          retest its condition prior to reiterating.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>goto statement</td>
        <td>Transfers control to the labeled statement.</td>

    <div class="SubTopic">The Infinite Loop</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The
      for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three
      expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless
      loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
		<code>
#include <stdio.h> 
int main () {

    for( ; ; ) {
        printf("This loop will run forever.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
		</code>
</pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.<br/>
            <strong>NOTE - You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.</strong></p>
