  <p class="ParaDetail">
    Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are
    performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic
    memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it
    becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer.
    Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.<br /><br />
    As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location
    has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&)
    operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following
    example, which prints the address of the variables defined :
  </p>
  <pre class="CodeBlock">
      <code>
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

    int  var1;
    char var2[10];

    printf("Address of var1 variable: %x\n", &var1  );
    printf("Address of var2 variable: %x\n", &var2  );

    return 0;
}
      </code>
    </pre>
  <p class="ParaDetail"> When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result :</p>
  <pre class="CodeBlock">
		<code>
Address of var1 variable: bff5a400
Address of var2 variable: bff5a3f6
		</code>
  </pre>
  <div class="SubTopic">What are Pointers?</div>
  <p class="ParaDetail">A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of
    the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any
    variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is :</p>
  <pre class="CodeBlock">
		<code>
type *var-name;
		</code>
  </pre>
  <p class="ParaDetail">Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name
    of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication.
    However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of
    the valid pointer declarations :</p>
  <pre class="CodeBlock">
      <code>
int    *ip;    /* pointer to an integer */
double *dp;    /* pointer to a double */
float  *fp;    /* pointer to a float */
char   *ch     /* pointer to a character */
      </code>
    </pre>
  <p class="ParaDetail">The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or
    otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between
    pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.</p>
  <div class="SubTopic">How to Use Pointers?</div>
  <p class="ParaDetail">There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very
    frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally
    access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that
    returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use
    of these operations :</p>
  <pre class="CodeBlock">
        <code>
#include <stdio.h>
int main () {

    int  var = 20;   /* actual variable declaration */
    int  *ip;        /* pointer variable declaration */

    ip = &var;  /* store address of var in pointer variable*/

    printf("Address of var variable: %x\n", &var  );

    /* address stored in pointer variable */
    printf("Address stored in ip variable: %x\n", ip );

    /* access the value using the pointer */
    printf("Value of *ip variable: %d\n", *ip );

    return 0;
}
        </code>
      </pre>
  <p class="ParaDetail">When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result :</p>
  <pre class="CodeBlock">
          <code>
Address of var variable: bffd8b3c
Address stored in ip variable: bffd8b3c
Value of *ip variable: 20
          </code>
        </pre>
  <div class="SubTopic">NULL Pointers</div>
  <p class="ParaDetail">It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not
    have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned
    NULL is called a null pointer.<br />
    The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following
    program :</p>

  <pre class="CodeBlock">
      <code>
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

    int  *ptr = NULL;

    printf("The value of ptr is : %x\n", ptr  );
  
    return 0;
}
      </code>
    </pre>
  <p class="ParaDetail">When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result :</p>
  <pre class="CodeBlock">
        <code>
The value of ptr is 0
        </code>
      </pre>
  <p class="ParaDetail">In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0
    because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it
    signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer
    contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.<br />
    To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows :</p>
  <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
if(ptr)     /* succeeds if p is not null */
if(!ptr)    /* succeeds if p is null */
            </code>
          </pre>

  <p class="ParaDetail">Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The
    following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer :</p>
