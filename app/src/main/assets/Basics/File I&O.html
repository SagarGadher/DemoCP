      The last chapter explained the standard input and output devices handled
      by C programming language. This chapter cover how C programmers can
      create, open, close text or binary files for their data storage.<br /><br />
      A file represents a sequence of bytes, regardless of it being a text file
      or a binary file. C programming language provides access on high level
      functions as well as low level (OS level) calls to handle file on your
      storage devices. This chapter will take you through the important calls
      for file management.
    </p>
    <div class="SubTopic">Opening Files</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      You can use the fopen( ) function to create a new file or to open an
      existing file. This call will initialize an object of the type FILE, which
      contains all the information necessary to control the stream. The
      prototype of this function call is as follows :
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
                <code>
FILE *fopen( const char * filename, const char * mode );
                </code>
        </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      Here, filename is a string literal, which you will use to name your file,
      and access mode can have one of the following values :
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Sr.No.</th>
        <th>Mode</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>r</td>
        <td>Opens an existing text file for reading purpose.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>w</td>
        <td>
          Opens a text file for writing. If it does not exist, then a new file
          is created. Here your program will start writing content from the
          beginning of the file.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>a</td>
        <td>
          Opens a text file for writing in appending mode. If it does not exist,
          then a new file is created. Here your program will start appending
          content in the existing file content.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>r+</td>
        <td>Opens a text file for both reading and writing.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>w+</td>
        <td>
          Opens a text file for both reading and writing. It first truncates the
          file to zero length if it exists, otherwise creates a file if it does
          not exist.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>a+</td>
        <td>
          Opens a text file for both reading and writing. It creates the file if
          it does not exist. The reading will start from the beginning but
          writing can only be appended.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p class="ParaDetail">
      If you are going to handle binary files, then you will use following
      access modes instead of the above mentioned ones :
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
"rb", "wb", "ab", "rb+", "r+b", "wb+", "w+b", "ab+", "a+b"
            </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="SubTopic">Closing a File</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      To close a file, use the fclose( ) function. The prototype of this
      function is :
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
int fclose( FILE *fp );
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      The fclose(-) function returns zero on success, or EOF if there is an
      error in closing the file. This function actually flushes any data still
      pending in the buffer to the file, closes the file, and releases any
      memory used for the file. The EOF is a constant defined in the header file
      stdio.h.<br /><br />
      There are various functions provided by C standard library to read and
      write a file, character by character, or in the form of a fixed length
      string.
    </p>
    <div class="SubTopic">Writing a File</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      Following is the simplest function to write individual characters to a
      stream :
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
int fputc( int c, FILE *fp );
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      The function fputc() writes the character value of the argument c to the
      output stream referenced by fp. It returns the written character written
      on success otherwise EOF if there is an error. You can use the following
      functions to write a null-terminated string to a stream :
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
int fputs( const char *s, FILE *fp );
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      The function fputs() writes the string s to the output stream referenced
      by fp. It returns a non-negative value on success, otherwise EOF is
      returned in case of any error. You can use int fprintf(FILE *fp,const char
      *format, ...) function as well to write a string into a file. Try the
      following example.<br /><br />
      Make sure you have /tmp directory available. If it is not, then before
      proceeding, you must create this directory on your machine.
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
#include <stdio.h>

main() {
    FILE *fp;

    fp = fopen("/tmp/test.txt", "w+");
    fprintf(fp, "This is testing for fprintf...\n");
    fputs("This is testing for fputs...\n", fp);
    fclose(fp);
}
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">When the above code is compiled and executed, it creates a new file test.txt in /tmp directory and writes two lines using two different functions. Let us read this file in the next section.</p>
    <div class="SubTopic">Reading a File</div>
    <p class="ParaDetail">Given below is the simplest function to read a single character from a file :</p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
int fgetc( FILE * fp );
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">The fgetc() function reads a character from the input file referenced by fp. The return value is the character read, or in case of any error, it returns EOF. The following function allows to read a string from a stream :</p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
char *fgets( char *buf, int n, FILE *fp );
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">The functions fgets() reads up to n-1 characters from the input stream referenced by fp. It copies the read string into the buffer buf, appending a null character to terminate the string.<br/><br/>
        If this function encounters a newline character '\n' or the end of the file EOF before they have read the maximum number of characters, then it returns only the characters read up to that point including the new line character. You can also use int fscanf(FILE *fp, const char *format, ...) function to read strings from a file, but it stops reading after encountering the first space character.</p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
#include <stdio.h>

main() {

    FILE *fp;
    char buff[255];

    fp = fopen("/tmp/test.txt", "r");
    fscanf(fp, "%s", buff);
    printf("1 : %s\n", buff );

    fgets(buff, 255, (FILE*)fp);
    printf("2: %s\n", buff );
    
    fgets(buff, 255, (FILE*)fp);
    printf("3: %s\n", buff );
    fclose(fp);

}
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">When the above code is compiled and executed, it reads the file created in the previous section and produces the following result :</p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
            <code>
1 : This
2: is testing for fprintf...
3: This is testing for fputs...
            </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">Let's see a little more in detail about what happened here. First, fscanf() read just This because after that, it encountered a space, second call is for fgets() which reads the remaining line till it encountered end of line. Finally, the last call fgets() reads the second line completely.</p>
    <div class="SubTopic">Binary I/O Functions</div>  
    <p class="ParaDetail">There are two functions, that can be used for binary input and output :</p>
    
  <pre class="CodeBlock">
		<code>
size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size_of_elements, size_t number_of_elements, FILE *a_file);

size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size_of_elements, size_t number_of_elements, FILE *a_file);
		</code>
</pre>
<p class="ParaDetail">Both of these functions should be used to read or write blocks of memories - usually arrays or structures.</p>
