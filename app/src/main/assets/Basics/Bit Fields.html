    <p class="ParaDetail">
      Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped
      in a structure called status, as follows :
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
		<code>
struct {
    unsigned int widthValidated;
    unsigned int heightValidated;
} status;
		</code>
</pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are
      going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming
      language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such
      situations.<br /><br />
      If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the
      width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use
      only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be
      re-written as follows :
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
      <code>
struct {
  unsigned int widthValidated : 1;
  unsigned int heightValidated : 1;
} 
      </code>
  </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">
      The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable,
      but only 2 bits will be used to store the values. If you will use up to 32
      variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure
      will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will
      allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let
      us check the following example to understand the concept :
    </p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
    <code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

/* define simple structure */
struct {
    unsigned int widthValidated;
    unsigned int heightValidated;
} status1;

/* define a structure with bit fields */
struct {
    unsigned int widthValidated : 1;
    unsigned int heightValidated : 1;
} status2;
  
int main( ) {

    printf( "Memory size occupied by status1 : %d\n", sizeof(status1));
    printf( "Memory size occupied by status2 : %d\n", sizeof(status2));

    return 0;
}
    </code>
</pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result :</p>
    <pre class="CodeBlock">
  <code>
Memory size occupied by status1 : 8
Memory size occupied by status2 : 4
  </code>
</pre>

    <div class="SubTopic">Bit Field Declaration</div>
  <p class="ParaDetail">The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure :</p>  
  <pre class="CodeBlock">
      <code>
struct {
    type [member_name] : width ;
};
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="ParaDetail">The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field :</p>  
    <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Sr.No.</th>
          <th>Element</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>type</td>
          <td>An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>member_name</td>
          <td>The name of the bit-field.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>width</td>
          <td>The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p class="ParaDetail">The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows :</p>
      <pre class="CodeBlock">
          <code>
struct {
  unsigned int age : 3;
} Age;
          </code>
      </pre>
      <p class="ParaDetail">The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example :</p>
      <pre class="CodeBlock">
          <code>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

struct {
    unsigned int age : 3;
} Age;

int main( ) {

    Age.age = 4;
    printf( "Sizeof( Age ) : %d\n", sizeof(Age) );
    printf( "Age.age : %d\n", Age.age );

    Age.age = 7;
    printf( "Age.age : %d\n", Age.age );

    Age.age = 8;
    printf( "Age.age : %d\n", Age.age );

    return 0;
}
          </code>
      </pre>
      <p class="ParaDetail">When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result :</p>
      <pre class="CodeBlock">
          <code>
Sizeof( Age ) : 4
Age.age : 4
Age.age : 7
Age.age : 0   
          </code>
      </pre>
  </body>
